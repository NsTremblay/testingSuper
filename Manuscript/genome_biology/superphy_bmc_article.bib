The accessory genome is thought to be an important source of genetic variability in bacterial populations and is gained through lateral gene transfer, allowing subpopulations of bacteria to better adapt to specific niches. Low-cost and high-throughput sequencing platforms have created an exponential increase in genome sequence data and an opportunity to study the pan-genomes of many bacterial species. In this study, we describe a new online pan-genome sequence analysis program, Panseq.{\textless}/{AbstractText}{\textgreater}
{\textless}{AbstractText} Label="{RESULTS}" {NlmCategory}="{RESULTS}"{\textgreater}Panseq was used to identify Escherichia coli O157:H7 and E. coli K-12 genomic islands. Within a population of 60 E. coli O157:H7 strains, the existence of 65 accessory genomic regions identified by Panseq analysis was confirmed by {PCR}. The accessory genome and binary presence/absence data, and core genome and single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) of six L. monocytogenes strains were extracted with Panseq and hierarchically clustered and visualized. The nucleotide core and binary accessory data were also used to construct maximum parsimony ({MP}) trees, which were compared to the {MP} tree generated by multi-locus sequence typing ({MLST}). The topology of the accessory and core trees was identical but differed from the tree produced using seven {MLST} loci. The Loci Selector module found the most variable and discriminatory combinations of four loci within a 100 loci set among 10 strains in 1 s, compared to the 449 s required to exhaustively search for all possible combinations; it also found the most discriminatory 20 loci from a 96 loci E. coli O157:H7 {SNP} dataset.{\textless}/{AbstractText}{\textgreater}
{\textless}{AbstractText} Label="{CONCLUSION}" {NlmCategory}="{CONCLUSIONS}"{\textgreater}Panseq determines the core and accessory regions among a collection of genomic sequences based on user-defined parameters. It readily extracts regions unique to a genome or group of genomes, identifies {SNPs} within shared core genomic regions, constructs files for use in phylogeny programs based on both the presence/absence of accessory regions and {SNPs} within core regions and produces a graphical overview of the output. Panseq also includes a loci selector that calculates the most variable and discriminatory loci among sets of accessory loci or core gene {SNPs}.{\textless}/{AbstractText}{\textgreater}

	abstract = {Motivation: Phylogenetic tree-building methods use molecular data to represent the evolutionary history of genes and taxa. A recurrent problem is to reconcile the various phylogenies built from different genomic sequences into a single one. This task is generally conducted by a two-step approach whereby a binary representation of the initial trees is first inferred and then a maximum parsimony ({MP}) analysis is performed on it. This binary representation uses a decomposition of all source trees that is usually based on clades, but that can also be based on triplets or quartets. The relative performances of these representations have been discussed but are difficult to assess since both are limited to relatively small datasets.
Results: This article focuses on the triplet-based representation of source trees. We first recall how, using this representation, the parsimony analysis is related to the median tree notion. We then introduce {SuperTriplets}, a new algorithm that is specially designed to optimize this alternative formulation of the {MP} criterion. The method avoids several practical limitations of the triplet-based binary matrix representation, making it useful to deal with large datasets. When the correct resolution of every triplet appears more often than the incorrect ones in source trees, {SuperTriplets} warrants to reconstruct the correct phylogeny. Both simulations and a case study on mammalian phylogenomics confirm the advantages of this approach. In both cases, {SuperTriplets} tends to propose less resolved but more reliable supertrees than those inferred using Matrix Representation with Parsimony.

	abstract = {The field of antibiotic drug discovery and the monitoring of new antibiotic resistance elements have yet to fully exploit the power of the genome revolution. Despite the fact that the first genomes sequenced of free living organisms were those of bacteria, there have been few specialized bioinformatic tools developed to mine the growing amount of genomic data associated with pathogens. In particular, there are few tools to study the genetics and genomics of antibiotic resistance and how it impacts bacterial populations, ecology, and the clinic. We have initiated development of such tools in the form of the Comprehensive Antibiotic Research Database ({CARD}; http://arpcard.mcmaster.ca). The {CARD} integrates disparate molecular and sequence data, provides a unique organizing principle in the form of the Antibiotic Resistance Ontology ({ARO}), and can quickly identify putative antibiotic resistance genes in new unannotated genome sequences. This unique platform provides an informatic tool that bridges antibiotic resistance concerns in health care, agriculture, and the environment.},

	abstract = {Analysis of microbial epidemics has been revolutionized by whole-genome sequencing. We recently sequenced the genomes of 601 type emm59 Group A Streptococcus ({GAS}) organisms responsible for an ongoing epidemic of invasive infections in Canada and some of the United States. The epidemic has been caused by the emergence of a genetically distinct, hypervirulent clone that has genetically diversified. The ease of obtaining genomic data contrasts with the relatively difficult task of translating them into insightful epidemiological information. Here, we sequenced the genomes of 90 additional invasive Canadian emm59 {GAS} organisms, including 80 isolated recently in 2010â2011. We used an improved bioinformatics pipeline designed to rapidly process and analyze whole-genome data and integrate strain metadata. We discovered that emm59 {GAS} organisms are undergoing continued multiclonal evolutionary expansion. Previously identified geographic patterns of strain dissemination are being diluted as mixing of subclones over time and space occurs. Our integrated data analysis strategy permits prompt and accurate mapping of the dissemination of bacterial organisms in an epidemic wave, permitting rapid generation of hypotheses that inform public health and virulence studies.},

	abstract = {Objectives Epidemiological investigations of Legionnairesâ disease outbreaks rely on the rapid identification and typing of clinical and environmental Legionella isolates in order to identify and control the source of infection. Rapid bacterial whole-genome sequencing ({WGS}) is an emerging technology that has the potential to rapidly discriminate outbreak from non-outbreak isolates in a clinically relevant time frame.
Methods We performed a pilot study to determine the feasibility of using bacterial {WGS} to differentiate outbreak from non-outbreak isolates collected during an outbreak of Legionnairesâ disease. Seven Legionella isolates (three clinical and four environmental) were obtained from the reference laboratory and sequenced using the Illumina {MiSeq} platform at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge. Bioinformatic analysis was performed blinded to the epidemiological data at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute.
Results We were able to distinguish outbreak from non-outbreak isolates using bacterial {WGS}, and to confirm the probable environmental source. Our analysis also highlighted constraints, which were the small number of Legionella pneumophila isolates available for sequencing, and the limited number of published genomes for comparison.
Conclusions We have demonstrated the feasibility of using rapid {WGS} to investigate an outbreak of Legionnairesâ disease. Future work includes building larger genomic databases of L pneumophila from both clinical and environmental sources, developing automated data interpretation software, and conducting a costâbenefit analysis of {WGS} versus current typing methods.},
