	abstract = {{\textless}{AbstractText} Label="{BACKGROUND}" {NlmCategory}="{BACKGROUND}"{\textgreater}The pan-genome of a bacterial species consists of a core and an accessory gene pool. The accessory genome is thought to be an important source of genetic variability in bacterial populations and is gained through lateral gene transfer, allowing subpopulations of bacteria to better adapt to specific niches. Low-cost and high-throughput sequencing platforms have created an exponential increase in genome sequence data and an opportunity to study the pan-genomes of many bacterial species. In this study, we describe a new online pan-genome sequence analysis program, Panseq.{\textless}/{AbstractText}{\textgreater}
{\textless}{AbstractText} Label="{RESULTS}" {NlmCategory}="{RESULTS}"{\textgreater}Panseq was used to identify Escherichia coli O157:H7 and E. coli K-12 genomic islands. Within a population of 60 E. coli O157:H7 strains, the existence of 65 accessory genomic regions identified by Panseq analysis was confirmed by {PCR}. The accessory genome and binary presence/absence data, and core genome and single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) of six L. monocytogenes strains were extracted with Panseq and hierarchically clustered and visualized. The nucleotide core and binary accessory data were also used to construct maximum parsimony ({MP}) trees, which were compared to the {MP} tree generated by multi-locus sequence typing ({MLST}). The topology of the accessory and core trees was identical but differed from the tree produced using seven {MLST} loci. The Loci Selector module found the most variable and discriminatory combinations of four loci within a 100 loci set among 10 strains in 1 s, compared to the 449 s required to exhaustively search for all possible combinations; it also found the most discriminatory 20 loci from a 96 loci E. coli O157:H7 {SNP} dataset.{\textless}/{AbstractText}{\textgreater}
{\textless}{AbstractText} Label="{CONCLUSION}" {NlmCategory}="{CONCLUSIONS}"{\textgreater}Panseq determines the core and accessory regions among a collection of genomic sequences based on user-defined parameters. It readily extracts regions unique to a genome or group of genomes, identifies {SNPs} within shared core genomic regions, constructs files for use in phylogeny programs based on both the presence/absence of accessory regions and {SNPs} within core regions and produces a graphical overview of the output. Panseq also includes a loci selector that calculates the most variable and discriminatory loci among sets of accessory loci or core gene {SNPs}.{\textless}/{AbstractText}{\textgreater}

	abstract = {Motivation: Phylogenetic tree-building methods use molecular data to represent the evolutionary history of genes and taxa. A recurrent problem is to reconcile the various phylogenies built from different genomic sequences into a single one. This task is generally conducted by a two-step approach whereby a binary representation of the initial trees is first inferred and then a maximum parsimony ({MP}) analysis is performed on it. This binary representation uses a decomposition of all source trees that is usually based on clades, but that can also be based on triplets or quartets. The relative performances of these representations have been discussed but are difficult to assess since both are limited to relatively small datasets.
Results: This article focuses on the triplet-based representation of source trees. We first recall how, using this representation, the parsimony analysis is related to the median tree notion. We then introduce {SuperTriplets}, a new algorithm that is specially designed to optimize this alternative formulation of the {MP} criterion. The method avoids several practical limitations of the triplet-based binary matrix representation, making it useful to deal with large datasets. When the correct resolution of every triplet appears more often than the incorrect ones in source trees, {SuperTriplets} warrants to reconstruct the correct phylogeny. Both simulations and a case study on mammalian phylogenomics confirm the advantages of this approach. In both cases, {SuperTriplets} tends to propose less resolved but more reliable supertrees than those inferred using Matrix Representation with Parsimony.

Despite the fact that the first genomes sequenced of free living organisms were those of bacteria, there have been few specialized bioinformatic tools developed to mine the growing amount of genomic data associated with pathogens. In particular, there are few tools to study the genetics and genomics of antibiotic resistance and how it impacts bacterial populations, ecology, and the clinic. We have initiated development of such tools in the form of the Comprehensive Antibiotic Research Database ({CARD}; http://arpcard.mcmaster.ca). The {CARD} integrates disparate molecular and sequence data, provides a unique organizing principle in the form of the Antibiotic Resistance Ontology ({ARO}), and can quickly identify putative antibiotic resistance genes in new unannotated genome sequences. This unique platform provides an informatic tool that bridges antibiotic resistance concerns in health care, agriculture, and the environment.},

We recently sequenced the genomes of 601 type emm59 Group A Streptococcus ({GAS}) organisms responsible for an ongoing epidemic of invasive infections in Canada and some of the United States. The epidemic has been caused by the emergence of a genetically distinct, hypervirulent clone that has genetically diversified. The ease of obtaining genomic data contrasts with the relatively difficult task of translating them into insightful epidemiological information. Here, we sequenced the genomes of 90 additional invasive Canadian emm59 {GAS} organisms, including 80 isolated recently in 2010–2011. We used an improved bioinformatics pipeline designed to rapidly process and analyze whole-genome data and integrate strain metadata. We discovered that emm59 {GAS} organisms are undergoing continued multiclonal evolutionary expansion. Previously identified geographic patterns of strain dissemination are being diluted as mixing of subclones over time and space occurs. Our integrated data analysis strategy permits prompt and accurate mapping of the dissemination of bacterial organisms in an epidemic wave, permitting rapid generation of hypotheses that inform public health and virulence studies.},

Rapid bacterial whole-genome sequencing ({WGS}) is an emerging technology that has the potential to rapidly discriminate outbreak from non-outbreak isolates in a clinically relevant time frame.
Methods We performed a pilot study to determine the feasibility of using bacterial {WGS} to differentiate outbreak from non-outbreak isolates collected during an outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease. Seven Legionella isolates (three clinical and four environmental) were obtained from the reference laboratory and sequenced using the Illumina {MiSeq} platform at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge. Bioinformatic analysis was performed blinded to the epidemiological data at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute.
Results We were able to distinguish outbreak from non-outbreak isolates using bacterial {WGS}, and to confirm the probable environmental source. Our analysis also highlighted constraints, which were the small number of Legionella pneumophila isolates available for sequencing, and the limited number of published genomes for comparison.
Conclusions We have demonstrated the feasibility of using rapid {WGS} to investigate an outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease. Future work includes building larger genomic databases of L pneumophila from both clinical and environmental sources, developing automated data interpretation software, and conducting a cost–benefit analysis of {WGS} versus current typing methods.},

Current phenotypic procedures are sometimes associated with mistakes and may require further genetic testing. Whole-genome sequencing ({WGS}) may soon be within reach even for routine surveillance and clinical diagnostics. The aim of this study was to evaluate {WGS} as a routine tool for surveillance of antimicrobial resistance compared with current phenotypic procedures.
Methods Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed on 200 isolates originating from Danish pigs, covering four bacterial species. Genomic {DNA} was purified from all isolates and sequenced as paired-end reads on the Illumina platform. The web servers {ResFinder} and {MLST} (www.genomicepidemiology.org) were used to identify acquired antimicrobial resistance genes and {MLST} types (where {MLST} stands for multilocus sequence typing). {ResFinder} results were compared with phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing results using {EUCAST} epidemiological cut-off values and {MLST} types.
Results A total of 3051 different phenotypic tests were performed; 482 led to the categorizing of isolates as resistant and 2569 as susceptible. Seven cases of disagreement between tested and predicted susceptibility were observed, six of which were related to spectinomycin resistance in Escherichia coli. Correlation between {MLST} type and resistance profiles was only observed in Salmonella Typhimurium, where isolates belonging to sequence type ({ST}) 34 were more resistant than {ST}19 isolates.
Conclusions High concordance (99.74\%) between phenotypic and predicted antimicrobial susceptibility was observed. Thus, antimicrobial resistance testing based on {WGS} is an alternative to conventional phenotypic methods.},

We demonstrate the practical and rapid exploitation of whole genome sequencing to provide routine definitive characterisation of C. jejuni and C. coli for clinical and public health purposes. Short-read data from 384 Campylobacter clinical isolates collected over four months in Oxford, United Kingdom, were assembled de novo. Contigs were deposited on the {pubMLST}.org/campylobacter website and automatically annotated for 1667 loci. Typing and phylogenetic information were extracted and comparative analyses performed for various subsets of loci, up to the level of whole genome, using Genome Comparator and {NeighborNet} algorithms. The assembled sequences (for 379 isolates) were diverse, and resembled collections from previous studies of human campylobacteriosis. Small subsets of very closely related isolates mainly originated from repeated same patient samples, and in one case, a likely laboratory contamination. Much of the within patient variation occurred in phase variable genes. Clinically and epidemiologically informative data can be extracted from {WGS} data in real time with straightforward, publicly available tools. These analyses are highly scalable, transparent, do not require closely related genome reference sequences, and provide improved resolution: (i) among Campylobacter clonal complexes; and, (ii) between very closely related isolates. Additionally, these analyses rapidly differentiated unrelated isolates, allowing the detection of single strain clusters. The approach is widely applicable to human bacterial pathogens in real time in clinical laboratories with little specialist training required.},

	abstract = {Next-generation sequencing ({NGS}) of bacterial genomes has recently become more accessible and is now available to the routine diagnostic microbiology laboratory. However, questions remain regarding its feasibility, particularly with respect to data analysis in nonspecialist centers. To test the applicability of {NGS} to outbreak investigations, Ion Torrent sequencing was used to investigate a putative multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli outbreak in the neonatal unit of the Mercy Hospital for Women, Melbourne, Australia. Four suspected outbreak strains and a comparator strain were sequenced. Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP}) analysis demonstrated that the four neonatal intensive care unit ({NICU}) strains were identical and easily differentiated from the comparator strain. Genome sequence data also determined that the {NICU} strains belonged to multilocus sequence type 131 and carried the {blaCTX}-M-15 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. Comparison of the outbreak strains to all publicly available complete E. coli genome sequences showed that they clustered with neonatal meningitis and uropathogenic isolates. The turnaround time from a positive culture to the completion of sequencing (prior to data analysis) was 5 days, and the cost was approximately \$300 per strain (for the reagents only). The main obstacles to a mainstream adoption of {NGS} technologies in diagnostic microbiology laboratories are currently cost (although this is decreasing), a paucity of user-friendly and clinically focused bioinformatics platforms, and a lack of genomics expertise outside the research environment. Despite these hurdles, {NGS} technologies provide unparalleled high-resolution genotyping in a short time frame and are likely to be widely implemented in the field of diagnostic microbiology in the next few years, particularly for epidemiological investigations (replacing current typing methods) and the characterization of resistance determinants. Clinical microbiologists need to familiarize themselves with these technologies and their applications.},

It would fully integrate genomic sequence and annotation data with bibliographic, genetic, phenotypic and molecular data from the literature representing a distillation of the first 100 years of research on this major animal model system. In developing this new integrated schema, {FlyBase} also made a commitment to ensure that its design was generic, extensible and available as open source, so that it could be employed as the core schema of any model organism data repository, thereby avoiding redundant software development and potentially increasing interoperability. Our question was whether we could create a relational database schema that would be successfully reused.
Results: Chado is a relational database schema now being used to manage biological knowledge for a wide variety of organisms, from human to pathogens, especially the classes of information that directly or indirectly can be associated with genome sequences or the primary {RNA} and protein products encoded by a genome. Biological databases that conform to this schema can interoperate with one another, and with application software from the Generic Model Organism Database ({GMOD}) toolkit. Chado is distinctive because its design is driven by ontologies. The use of ontologies (or controlled vocabularies) is ubiquitous across the schema, as they are used as a means of typing entities. The Chado schema is partitioned into integrated subschemas (modules), each encapsulating a different biological domain, and each described using representations in appropriate ontologies. To illustrate this methodology, we describe here the Chado modules used for describing genomic sequences.

	abstract = {Background
We recently described {FastTree}, a tool for inferring phylogenies for alignments with up to hundreds of thousands of sequences. Here, we describe improvements to {FastTree} that improve its accuracy without sacrificing scalability.

Methodology/Principal Findings
Where {FastTree} 1 used nearest-neighbor interchanges ({NNIs}) and the minimum-evolution criterion to improve the tree, {FastTree} 2 adds minimum-evolution subtree-pruning-regrafting ({SPRs}) and maximum-likelihood {NNIs}. {FastTree} 2 uses heuristics to restrict the search for better trees and estimates a rate of evolution for each site (the “{CAT}” approximation). Nevertheless, for both simulated and genuine alignments, {FastTree} 2 is slightly more accurate than a standard implementation of maximum-likelihood {NNIs} ({PhyML} 3 with default settings). Although {FastTree} 2 is not quite as accurate as methods that use maximum-likelihood {SPRs}, most of the splits that disagree are poorly supported, and for large alignments, {FastTree} 2 is 100–1,000 times faster. {FastTree} 2 inferred a topology and likelihood-based local support values for 237,882 distinct 16S ribosomal {RNAs} on a desktop computer in 22 hours and 5.8 gigabytes of memory.

Conclusions/Significance
{FastTree} 2 allows the inference of maximum-likelihood phylogenies for huge alignments. {FastTree} 2 is freely available at http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree.},

	abstract = {Summary: Clearcut is an open source implementation for the relaxed neighbor joining ({RNJ}) algorithm. While traditional neighbor joining ({NJ}) remains a popular method for distance-based phylogenetic tree reconstruction, it suffers from a O(N3) time complexity, where N represents the number of taxa in the input. Due to this steep asymptotic time complexity, {NJ} cannot reasonably handle very large datasets. In contrast, {RNJ} realizes a typical-case time complexity on the order of N2logN without any significant qualitative difference in output. {RNJ} is particularly useful when inferring a very large tree or a large number of trees. In addition, {RNJ} retains the desirable property that it will always reconstruct the true tree given a matrix of additive pairwise distances. Clearcut implements {RNJ} as a C program, which takes either a set of aligned sequences or a pre-computed distance matrix as input and produces a phylogenetic tree. Alternatively, Clearcut can reconstruct phylogenies using an extremely fast standard {NJ} implementation.

Here, we analyzed multiple genomes of Escherichia coli, Shigella spp., and Salmonella enterica. We demonstrate that the distribution of the number of genomes harboring a gene is well approximated by a sum of two power functions, describing frequent genes (present in many strains) and rare genes (present in few strains). The virtual absence of Shigella-specific genes not present in E. coli genomes confirms previous observations that Shigella is not an independent genus. While the pan-genome size is increasing with each new strain, the number of genes present in a fixed fraction of strains stabilizes quickly. For instance, slightly fewer than 4,000 genes are present in at least half of any group of E. coli genomes. Comparison of S. enterica and E. coli pan-genomes revealed the existence of a common periphery, that is, genes present in some but not all strains of both species. Analysis of phylogenetic trees demonstrates that rare genes from the periphery likely evolve under horizontal transfer, whereas frequent periphery genes may have been inherited from the periphery genome of the common ancestor.},

Sixty-one publically available E. coli and Shigella spp. sequenced genomes are compared, using basic methods to produce phylogenetic and proteomics trees, and to identify the pan- and core genomes of this set of sequenced strains. A hierarchical clustering of variable genes allowed clear separation of the strains into clusters, including known pathotypes; clinically relevant serotypes can also be resolved in this way. In contrast, when in silico {MLST} was performed, many of the various strains appear jumbled and less well resolved. The predicted pan-genome comprises 15,741 gene families, and only 993 (6\%) of the families are represented in every genome, comprising the core genome. The variable or 'accessory' genes thus make up more than 90\% of the pan-genome and about 80\% of a typical genome; some of these variable genes tend to be co-localized on genomic islands. The diversity within the species E. coli, and the overlap in gene content between this and related species, suggests a continuum rather than sharp species borders in this group of Enterobacteriaceae.},

Electrophoretic distribution of esterases was distinct for each of the three subspecific groups as indicated by distributions of allozymes and electrophoretic types (distinctive combination of allozyme for the four esterases). Esterase polymorphisms of the three subspecific groups appeared to have similar features to those of three previously studied natural populations of strains obtained from human and animal gastro-intestinal tracts and extra-intestinal infections in humans. Multiple correspondence analyses using data obtained from the four esterases and the 11 other enzymes also distinguished the groups A, B1, B2, C, D and E. All strains of group B2 showed the B2 electrophoretic pattern of esterase B, which appeared to be a marker of a distinct cluster of strains frequently implicated in extra-intestinal infections.},

	abstract = {A decade after the beginning of the genomic era, the question of how genomics can describe a bacterial species has not been fully addressed. Experimental data have shown that in some species new genes are discovered even after sequencing the genomes of several strains. Mathematical modeling predicts that new genes will be discovered even after sequencing hundreds of genomes per species. Therefore, a bacterial species can be described by its pan-genome, which is composed of a "core genome" containing genes present in all strains, and a "dispensable genome" containing genes present in two or more strains and genes unique to single strains. Given that the number of unique genes is vast, the pan-genome of a bacterial species might be orders of magnitude larger than any single genome.},
