The availability of deep (and large) genomic data sets raises concerns over information access, data security, and subject/patient privacy that must be addressed for the field to continue its rapid advances.},

Continual progress in next-generation sequencing allows for generating increasingly large metagenomes and studying multiple metagenomes over time or space. Recently, a new type of holistic ecosystem study has emerged that seeks to combine metagenomics with biodiversity, meta-expression and contextual data. Such 'ecosystems biology' approaches bear the potential to not only advance our understanding of environmental microbes to a new level but also impose challenges due to increasing data complexities, in particular with respect to bioinformatic post-processing. This mini review aims to address selected opportunities and challenges of modern metagenomics from a bioinformatics perspective and hopefully will serve as a useful resource for microbial ecologists and bioinformaticians alike.},

We compared the performance of these instruments by sequencing an isolate of Escherichia coli {O104:H4}, which caused an outbreak of food poisoning in Germany in 2011. The {MiSeq} had the highest throughput per run (1.6 Gb/run, 60 Mb/h) and lowest error rates. The 454 {GS} Junior generated the longest reads (up to 600 bases) and most contiguous assemblies but had the lowest throughput (70 Mb/run, 9 Mb/h). Run in 100-bp mode, the Ion Torrent {PGM} had the highest throughput (80–100 Mb/h).

Low-cost and high-throughput sequencing platforms have created an exponential increase in genome sequence data and an opportunity to study the pan-genomes of many bacterial species.

The nucleotide core and binary accessory data were also used to construct maximum parsimony ({MP)} trees, which were compared to the {MP} tree generated by multi-locus sequence typing ({MLST).} The topology of the accessory and core trees was identical but differed from the tree produced using seven {MLST} loci. The Loci Selector module found the most variable and discriminatory combinations of four loci within a 100 loci set among 10 strains in 1 s, compared to the 449 s required to exhaustively search for all possible combinations; it also found the most discriminatory 20 loci from a 96 loci E. coli {O157:H7} {SNP} dataset.{\textless}{/AbstractText{\textgreater}}

	abstract = {The pan-genome of a taxonomic group consists of evolutionarily conserved core genes shared by all members and accessory genes that are present only in some members of the group. Group- and subgroup-specific core genes are thought to contribute to shared phenotypes such as virulence and niche specificity. In this study we analyzed 39 Salmonella enterica genomes (16 closed, 23 draft), a species that contains two human-specific serovars that cause typhoid fever, as well as a large number of zoonotic serovars that cause gastroenteritis in humans. Panseq 2.0 was used to define the pan-genome by adjusting the threshold at which group-specific "core" loci are defined. We found the pan-genome to be {9.03Mbp} in size, and that the core genome size decreased, while the number of {SNPs/100bp} increased, as the number of strains used to define the core genome increased, suggesting substantial divergence among S. enterica subgroups. Subgroup-specific "core" genes, in contrast, had fewer {SNPs/100bp}, reflecting their more recent acquisition. Phylogenetic trees were created from the concatenated and aligned pan-genome, the core genome, and multi-locus-sequence typing ({MLST)} loci. Branch support increased among the trees, and strains of the same serovar grouped closer together as the number of loci used to create the tree increased. Further, high levels of discrimination were achieved even amongst the most closely related strains of S. enterica Typhi, suggesting that the data generated by Panseq may be of value in short-term epidemiological studies. Panseq provided an easy and fast way to perform pan-genomic analyses, which can include the identification of group-dominant as well as group-specific loci and is available as a web-server and a standalone version at http://lfz.corefacility.ca/panseq/.},

To address these challenges, we have developed {GEnomes} Management Application ({GEM.app)}, a software tool to annotate, manage, visualize, and analyze large genomic datasets (https://genomics.med.miami.edu/"{\textgreater}https://genomics.med.miami.edu/"{\textgreater}https://genomics.med.miami.edu/). {GEM.app} currently contains ∼1,600 whole exomes from 50 different phenotypes studied by 40 principal investigators from 15 different countries. The focus of {GEM.app} is on user-friendly analysis for nonbioinformaticians to make next-generation sequencing data directly accessible. Yet, {GEM.app} provides powerful and flexible filter options, including single family filtering, across family/phenotype queries, nested filtering, and evaluation of segregation in families. In addition, the system is fast, obtaining results within 4 sec across ∼1,200 exomes. We believe that this system will further enhance identification of genetic causes of human disease.},

For protein comparisons, a variety of definitional, algorithmic and statistical refinements described here permits the execution time of the {BLAST} programs to be decreased substantially while enhancing their sensitivity to weak similarities. A new criterion for triggering the extension of word hits, combined with a new heuristic for generating gapped alignments, yields a gapped {BLAST} program that runs at approximately three times the speed of the original. In addition, a method is introduced for automatically combining statistically significant alignments produced by {BLAST} into a position-specific score matrix, and searching the database using this matrix. The resulting Position-Specific Iterated {BLAST} ({PSI-BLAST)} program runs at approximately the same speed per iteration as gapped {BLAST}, but in many cases is much more sensitive to weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities. {PSI-BLAST} is used to uncover several new and interesting members of the {BRCT} superfamily.},

	abstract = {Background
We recently described {FastTree}, a tool for inferring phylogenies for alignments with up to hundreds of thousands of sequences. Here, we describe improvements to {FastTree} that improve its accuracy without sacrificing scalability.

{Methodology/Principal} Findings
Where {FastTree} 1 used nearest-neighbor interchanges ({NNIs)} and the minimum-evolution criterion to improve the tree, {FastTree} 2 adds minimum-evolution subtree-pruning-regrafting ({SPRs)} and maximum-likelihood {NNIs.} {FastTree} 2 uses heuristics to restrict the search for better trees and estimates a rate of evolution for each site (the {“CAT”} approximation). Nevertheless, for both simulated and genuine alignments, {FastTree} 2 is slightly more accurate than a standard implementation of maximum-likelihood {NNIs} ({PhyML} 3 with default settings). Although {FastTree} 2 is not quite as accurate as methods that use maximum-likelihood {SPRs}, most of the splits that disagree are poorly supported, and for large alignments, {FastTree} 2 is 100–1,000 times faster. {FastTree} 2 inferred a topology and likelihood-based local support values for 237,882 distinct {16S} ribosomal {RNAs} on a desktop computer in 22 hours and 5.8 gigabytes of memory.

{Conclusions/Significance}
{FastTree} 2 allows the inference of maximum-likelihood phylogenies for huge alignments. {FastTree} 2 is freely available at http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree.},

	abstract = {Escherichia coli is an important component of the biosphere and is an ideal model for studies of processes involved in bacterial genome evolution. Sixty-one publically available E. coli and Shigella spp. sequenced genomes are compared, using basic methods to produce phylogenetic and proteomics trees, and to identify the pan- and core genomes of this set of sequenced strains. A hierarchical clustering of variable genes allowed clear separation of the strains into clusters, including known pathotypes; clinically relevant serotypes can also be resolved in this way. In contrast, when in silico {MLST} was performed, many of the various strains appear jumbled and less well resolved. The predicted pan-genome comprises 15,741 gene families, and only 993 (6\%) of the families are represented in every genome, comprising the core genome. The variable or 'accessory' genes thus make up more than 90\% of the pan-genome and about 80\% of a typical genome; some of these variable genes tend to be co-localized on genomic islands. The diversity within the species E. coli, and the overlap in gene content between this and related species, suggests a continuum rather than sharp species borders in this group of Enterobacteriaceae.},

	abstract = {When Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli ({STEC)} strains emerged as agents of human disease, two types of toxin were identified: Shiga toxin type 1 (Stx1) (almost identical to Shiga toxin produced by Shigella dysenteriae type 1) and the immunologically distinct type 2 (Stx2). Subsequently, numerous {STEC} strains have been characterized that express toxins with variations in amino acid sequence, some of which confer unique biological properties. These variants were grouped within the Stx1 or Stx2 type and often assigned names to indicate that they were not identical in sequence or phenotype to the main Stx1 or Stx2 type. A lack of specificity or consistency in toxin nomenclature has led to much confusion in the characterization of {STEC} strains. Because serious outcomes of infection have been attributed to certain Stx subtypes and less so with others, we sought to better define the toxin subtypes within the main Stx1 and Stx2 types. We compared the levels of relatedness of 285 valid sequence variants of Stx1 and Stx2 and identified common sequences characteristic of each of three {Stx/Stx1} and seven Stx2 subtypes. A novel, simple {PCR} subtyping method was developed, independently tested on a battery of 48 prototypic {STEC} strains, and improved at six clinical and research centers to test the reproducibility, sensitivity, and specificity of the {PCR.} Using a consistent schema for nomenclature of the Stx toxins and stx genes by phylogenetic sequence-based relatedness of the holotoxin proteins, we developed a typing approach that should obviate the need to bioassay each newly described toxin and that predicts important biological characteristics.},

Now, genomic epidemiologists say, it's time to use the technique to track microbial movements on a global scale. By routinely sequencing bacterial samples—perhaps up to a billion a year—scientists could pinpoint the sources of new outbreaks faster, determine whether a bug is resistant to antibiotics, and investigate how public policies or the use of certain drugs change the course of microbial evolution. Four weeks ago, 25 scientists gathered in Brussels for 2 days to discuss how to mobilize such a massive effort and dream about the benefits it would offer. Participants concluded that the world needs a global system to share and mine genomic data for microorganisms. It could be operational in 5 to 10 years, they say—but there are some formidable obstacles.},
