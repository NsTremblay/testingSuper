The availability of deep (and large) genomic data sets raises concerns over information access, data security, and subject/patient privacy that must be addressed for the field to continue its rapid advances.},

	abstract = {Metagenomics has become an indispensable tool for studying the diversity and metabolic potential of environmental microbes, whose bulk is as yet non-cultivable. Continual progress in next-generation sequencing allows for generating increasingly large metagenomes and studying multiple metagenomes over time or space. Recently, a new type of holistic ecosystem study has emerged that seeks to combine metagenomics with biodiversity, meta-expression and contextual data. Such 'ecosystems biology' approaches bear the potential to not only advance our understanding of environmental microbes to a new level but also impose challenges due to increasing data complexities, in particular with respect to bioinformatic post-processing. This mini review aims to address selected opportunities and challenges of modern metagenomics from a bioinformatics perspective and hopefully will serve as a useful resource for microbial ecologists and bioinformaticians alike.},

Each instrument can generate data required for a draft bacterial genome sequence in days, making them attractive for identifying and characterizing pathogens in the clinical setting. We compared the performance of these instruments by sequencing an isolate of Escherichia coli {O104:H4}, which caused an outbreak of food poisoning in Germany in 2011. The {MiSeq} had the highest throughput per run (1.6 Gb/run, 60 Mb/h) and lowest error rates. The 454 {GS} Junior generated the longest reads (up to 600 bases) and most contiguous assemblies but had the lowest throughput (70 Mb/run, 9 Mb/h). Run in 100-bp mode, the Ion Torrent {PGM} had the highest throughput (80–100 Mb/h). Unlike the {MiSeq}, the Ion Torrent {PGM} and 454 {GS} Junior both produced homopolymer-associated indel errors (1.5 and 0.38 errors per 100 bases, respectively).},

The accessory genome is thought to be an important source of genetic variability in bacterial populations and is gained through lateral gene transfer, allowing subpopulations of bacteria to better adapt to specific niches. Low-cost and high-throughput sequencing platforms have created an exponential increase in genome sequence data and an opportunity to study the pan-genomes of many bacterial species. In this study, we describe a new online pan-genome sequence analysis program, Panseq.{\textless}{/AbstractText{\textgreater}}
{\textless}{AbstractText} {Label="RESULTS"} {NlmCategory="RESULTS"{\textgreater}Panseq} was used to identify Escherichia coli {O157:H7} and E. coli K-12 genomic islands. Within a population of 60 E. coli {O157:H7} strains, the existence of 65 accessory genomic regions identified by Panseq analysis was confirmed by {PCR.} The accessory genome and binary presence/absence data, and core genome and single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs)} of six L. monocytogenes strains were extracted with Panseq and hierarchically clustered and visualized. The nucleotide core and binary accessory data were also used to construct maximum parsimony ({MP)} trees, which were compared to the {MP} tree generated by multi-locus sequence typing ({MLST).} The topology of the accessory and core trees was identical but differed from the tree produced using seven {MLST} loci. The Loci Selector module found the most variable and discriminatory combinations of four loci within a 100 loci set among 10 strains in 1 s, compared to the 449 s required to exhaustively search for all possible combinations; it also found the most discriminatory 20 loci from a 96 loci E. coli {O157:H7} {SNP} dataset.{\textless}{/AbstractText{\textgreater}}
{\textless}{AbstractText} {Label="CONCLUSION"} {NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS"{\textgreater}Panseq} determines the core and accessory regions among a collection of genomic sequences based on user-defined parameters.

	abstract = {The pan-genome of a taxonomic group consists of evolutionarily conserved core genes shared by all members and accessory genes that are present only in some members of the group. Group- and subgroup-specific core genes are thought to contribute to shared phenotypes such as virulence and niche specificity. In this study we analyzed 39 Salmonella enterica genomes (16 closed, 23 draft), a species that contains two human-specific serovars that cause typhoid fever, as well as a large number of zoonotic serovars that cause gastroenteritis in humans. Panseq 2.0 was used to define the pan-genome by adjusting the threshold at which group-specific "core" loci are defined. We found the pan-genome to be {9.03Mbp} in size, and that the core genome size decreased, while the number of {SNPs/100bp} increased, as the number of strains used to define the core genome increased, suggesting substantial divergence among S. enterica subgroups. Subgroup-specific "core" genes, in contrast, had fewer {SNPs/100bp}, reflecting their more recent acquisition. Phylogenetic trees were created from the concatenated and aligned pan-genome, the core genome, and multi-locus-sequence typing ({MLST)} loci. Branch support increased among the trees, and strains of the same serovar grouped closer together as the number of loci used to create the tree increased. Further, high levels of discrimination were achieved even amongst the most closely related strains of S. enterica Typhi, suggesting that the data generated by Panseq may be of value in short-term epidemiological studies. Panseq provided an easy and fast way to perform pan-genomic analyses, which can include the identification of group-dominant as well as group-specific loci and is available as a web-server and a standalone version at http://lfz.corefacility.ca/panseq/.},

For example, analysis methods such as for calculating distance between sequences by genomic signatures and for predicting gene expression levels from codon usage bias are effective in the interpretation of meta-genomic and meta-transcriptomic data. {GEMBASSY} tools can be used seamlessly with other {EMBOSS} tools and {UNIX} command line tools.

However, new challenges have also become evident: (1) effectively managing larger exome and/or genome datasets, especially for smaller labs; (2) direct hands-on analysis and contextual interpretation of variant data in large genomic datasets; and (3) many small and medium-sized clinical and research-based investigative teams around the world are generating data that, if combined and shared, will significantly increase the opportunities for the entire community to identify new genes. To address these challenges, we have developed {GEnomes} Management Application ({GEM.app)}, a software tool to annotate, manage, visualize, and analyze large genomic datasets (https://genomics.med.miami.edu/"{\textgreater}https://genomics.med.miami.edu/"{\textgreater}https://genomics.med.miami.edu/). {GEM.app} currently contains ∼1,600 whole exomes from 50 different phenotypes studied by 40 principal investigators from 15 different countries. The focus of {GEM.app} is on user-friendly analysis for nonbioinformaticians to make next-generation sequencing data directly accessible. Yet, {GEM.app} provides powerful and flexible filter options, including single family filtering, across family/phenotype queries, nested filtering, and evaluation of segregation in families. In addition, the system is fast, obtaining results within 4 sec across ∼1,200 exomes. We believe that this system will further enhance identification of genetic causes of human disease.},
