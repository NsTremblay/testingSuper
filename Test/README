This is a test file containing a working display page example. It is simply used as an illustrative tool
to show that things are working at the very basic level.

To see actual production code please consult one of the other folders in this repository or
the master branch.

The modules contain the details required to connect to a local Chado test database, pull data and display
it onto a localhost webpage.

Modules, Roles, Templates, and Pages are kept separate from eachother and used only where needed.
This keeps the code clean and easier to read.

For specific inquiries about code please consult the documentation.
